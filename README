REQUIREMENTS
========================

- OpenCV 2.1+: http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/

	svn co https://code.ros.org/svn/opencv/trunk/opencv -r 3513
	cd opencv
	sudo cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" .
	sudo make
	sudo make install

	Note: We have also enabled alpha-channel in OpenCV as described here:
	http://blog.developer.stylight.de/2010/05/how-to-load-alpha-channel-pngs-with.html

- Boost - http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.44.0/

- FFMPEG (fetched automatically with checkout.sh)



OSX NOTES
========================

- If you are a developer, it helps to set the openCV CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to 'Debug'.  You can change this by running the following:
	
	sudo cmake -i -G "Unix Makefiles" .

- Unlogo uses a lot of bleeding-edge stuff. Update your MacPorts!

	sudo port selfupdate
	sudo port upgrade outdated

- In OpenCV rev 3513, you might need to apply some changes.

You can use 'patch' to apply the changes to OpenCV. Run the following
command in the root of your OpenCV checkout:

	patch -p0 -i PATH_TO_UNLOGO/osx_gpu_propagation_fix_opencv_rev3515.patch

Or change line 55 in both opencv/modules/gpu/src/constantspacebp_gpu.cpp and opencv/modules/gpu/src/beliefpropagation_gpu.cpp from 

	void cv::gpu::StereoBeliefPropagation::operator()(const GpuMat&, const GpuMat&, GpuMat&, const Stream&) { throw_nogpu(); }

to

	void cv::gpu::StereoBeliefPropagation::operator()(const GpuMat&, const GpuMat&, GpuMat&, Stream&) { throw_nogpu(); }

- In OpenCV rev 3513 opencv/modules/gpu/src/matrix_operations.cpp, comment out line 71 -- the function doesn't exist.

	//void MatPL::get_property_device() { throw_nogpu(); }



BUILDING
========================

The Unlogo filter uses the 'plugin' AVFilter for FFMPEG written by Kashif Balil.  This greatly simplifies and speeds up the process of making a filter by allowing the user to reference a shared object when running FFMPEG rather than having to recompile all of FFMPEG with every change. So the first thing you need to do is compile a version of FFMPEG with the 'plugin' filter.   
Note:  Libavfilter is only available in the 0.6 branch. Older version of FFMPEG will not work. 

- Run checkout.sh

	./checkout.sh

- Configure and build FFMPEG as you normally would. Google is full of tutorials of how to build FFMPEG on your particular platform.  This works for me:

	cd ffmpeg
	./configure --arch=x86 --enable-libmp3lame --enable-libx264 --enable-nonfree --enable-gpl --disable-doc --prefix=../
	make
	make install

- Now make logo.so by running 'make' from the root directory.  Make sure you've already installed the requirements listed above


- You're done!  



INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
========================

To use the filter, make sure to use the version of FFMPEG that you just built, and then do something like this: 

	ffmpeg -qscale 2 -i [input video] -vf plugin=unlogo.so:[detector type]:[descriptor extracor type]:[matcher type]:[logo image(s)] -y [output file name]

	ffmpeg -qscale 2 -i share/videos/IMG_0092.MOV -vf plugin=unlogo.so:SURF:SURF:BruteForce:share/logos/Dior.jpg:#FF00FF:share/logos/Chanel.jpg:#FFFFFF -y out.mov

Possible values as of OpenCV 3513 are:

- Detector Types
	FAST, STAR, SIFT, SURF, MSER, GFTT, HARRIS
	
- Descriptor Types
	SIFT, SURF
	
- Descriptor Matcher Types
	BruteForce, BruteForce-L1



TROUBLESHOOTING
========================
- make logo.so
On OS X 10.5 (gcc version 4.0.1) change the Makefile
g++ -shared -o unlogo.so $(OBJS) $(LIBS)
g++ -bundle -o unlogo.so $(OBJS) $(LIBS)
(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1494407/undefined-symbol-main-when-trying-to-build-shared-library-g-mac)

If you get "error: boost/algorithm/string.hpp: No such file or directory" specify the path to your boost installation in the Makefile INCLUDES
-I/usr/bin/boost_1_44_0



TO DO
=========================	
- Save out descriptors and keypoints to text files with FileStorage objects
- Config file input
